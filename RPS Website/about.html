        <h1>About Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>In Rock Paper Scissors 2 players shape their hands to form a rock, a sheet of paper, or a pair of scissors. At the same time, they shape their hand to determine the winner. Paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beat paper. Each choice has an equal chance of winning, losing, and tying.</p><br>
        <h3>Origin</h3>
        <p>The first known mention of the game was in the book Wuzazu by the Ming-dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhe (fl. c. 1600), who wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE).[9] In the book, the game was called shoushiling. Li Rihua's book Note of Liuyanzhai also mentions this game, calling it shoushiling (t. 手勢令; s. 手势令), huozhitou (t. 豁指頭; s. 豁指头), or huaquan (划拳). <br><br>

        Throughout Japanese history there are frequent references to sansukumi-ken, meaning ken (fist) games "of the three who are afraid of one another" (i.e. A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A). This type of game originated in China before being imported to Japan and subsequently also becoming popular among the Japanese.(Wikipedia)</p>
